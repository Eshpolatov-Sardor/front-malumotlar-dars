                Mountain Expeditions is a small UK company owned and run by Jon Gupta. We specialise in bespoke,
                professional and seamlessly-run expeditions around the world.
            </div>
            <div class="top">We operate in 6 countries. We respect and value the local communities with whom we work and
                have nurtured and built strong relationships with them. As a result, we feel we have a deeper
                understanding of how to best deliver the trip of a lifetime to you.</div>
            <div class="top">A successful expedition is made up of the hundreds of small wonderful experiences gained
                from start to finish. We therefore ensure that every aspect of your trip is expertly organised and
                well-managed.</div>

                    <h1>Our Leaders</h1>
                    <p>On every expedition, the number of participants is kept to a level to enable the highest quality
                        to
                        be maintained. We do not want to be that company where you become a number or even a blur after
                        the
                        expedition has finished, so we have a strict cut off point to ensure that our groups never
                        become
                        too big.</p>
                    <p>We strongly believe that by doing this our Mountain Expeditions Leaders are able to provide a
                        more
                        personalised service and we find that group dynamics work much better than when travelling in
                        high
                        numbers. Therefore, your success rate and enjoyment increases immeasurably.</p>
